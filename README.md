# Bikesharing

## Overview 

Analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City and show future investors that a bikeshare program in Des Moines Iowa can be a profitable business. Before that we need to look into the data number of short-term customers and annual subscribers to the Citi Bike service. This will help us determine the types of customers we could expect for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines. Specifically, you want to find out how the proportion of short-term customers to annual subscribers has changed. This analysis might help answer a few more key questions:

Who uses bikeshare programs?
How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
How much are the bikes used and by whom?
What days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender?
